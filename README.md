### Maze-Solver

A guided python project from the boot.dev course.

This application randomly generates a maze and subsequently visualizes a recursive solving method to show a path from the maze start (cell at 0,0) to maze end (-1, -1).

To start just run the following command:

		python maze.py

Note: This uses the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package to interface with the Tk GUI.
You can run the following command to check your installation and version:
		python -m tkinter
